## Voter ID

You may be asked to show identification in Iowa if:

* you registered to vote by mail after January 1, 2003 and have never voted in a primary or general election in your county;
* you have moved from where you are registered to vote;
* your right to vote has been challenged;
* or the precinct election officials do not know you.

If you are asked to show identification, you may use a current and valid photo ID or any of the following documents if they show your name and current address: current utility bill (including cell phone bill), bank statement, paycheck or government check, or other current government document.
