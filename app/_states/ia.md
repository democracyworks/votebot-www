## Voter ID

If you've voted in Iowa before, you don’t need to provide ID to vote.

If you’re a first-time voter who registered by mail, and didn’t provide your driver’s license number, state ID number, or the last 4 digits of your social security number on your registration form, you might need to present ID to vote.  Acceptable forms include: current and valid photo ID; or a current utility bill (including cell phone bill), bank statement, paycheck or government check, or other current government document that shows your name and address.
