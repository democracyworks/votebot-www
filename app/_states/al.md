## Voter ID 

You will need to show photo ID to vote in Alabama.

Acceptable forms of valid (non-expired) photo ID include: Alabama driver's license; Alabama nondriver ID card; Alabama photo voter ID card; photo ID card issued by Alabama or any other state; federal government issued ID; US passport; employee ID card issued by the federal government, the State of Alabama, county, municipality, board or other entity in Alabama; student or employee ID issued by a public or private college or university in Alabama; student or employee ID issued by a state institution of higher learning in any other state; US military ID; or a valid tribal ID.

Voters without ID: If you do not show valid ID, you will be allowed to vote a provisional ballot. If you vote a provisional ballot, you must provide your ID, including your address and your telephone number, to the board of registrars no later than 5:00 P.M. on the Friday following the election. If you fail to provide ID to the board of registrars by that time, your ballot will not be counted. In addition, voters who do show valid photo ID at the polls can vote a regular ballot if they are positively identified by two election officials as a voter on the poll list who is eligible to vote and the election officials sign a sworn affidavit.
