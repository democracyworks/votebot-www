## Voter ID 

You will need to show photo ID to vote in Alabama.

Acceptable forms of ID include a valid (non-expired): Alabama driver's license; Alabama nondriver identification card; Alabama photo identification card; photo identification card issued by Alabama, any other state, or the United States; US passport; employee identification card issued by Alabama or the U.S. containing a photograph; student or employee identification issued by a public or private college in Alabama containing a photograph, U.S. military identification card with a photograph; or a valid tribal identification card containing a photograph. The voter must bring one of these photo IDs to the polls on Election Day.

Voters without ID: A voter who is required to present valid photo identification but who does not do so will be allowed to vote a provisional ballot as provided for by law. If the voter's ballot becomes a provisional ballot due to lack of identification, the identification, including the address and telephone number of the voter, must be provided to the board of registrars no later than 5:00 P.M. on the Friday following the election. If the voter fails to provide identification to the board of registrars by 5:00 P.M. on the Friday following the election, the voter's ballot shall not be counted. In addition, a voter who does not have a valid photo ID in his or her possession at the polls shall be permitted to vote a regular ballot if the individual is positively identified by two election officials as a voter on the poll list who is eligible to vote and the election officials sign a sworn affidavit so stating.
