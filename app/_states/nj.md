## Voter ID

If the driver's license number or social security number on your voter registration form was verified, you do not need to provide ID in order to vote.

Otherwise, as a first-time voter in New Jersey, you must bring a valid, current photo ID, NJ driver's license, military or other government ID, student or job ID, store membership card, or bank statement, pay check, car registration, rent receipt, sample ballot, government check, or document, utility bill, non-photo NJ driver's license.
