## Voter ID

If you've voted in New Jersey before, you don’t need to provide ID to vote.

If you’re voting for the first-time in your county, registered to vote by mail, and didn’t provide an ID number or copy of ID when you registered, you must show ID to vote. Acceptable forms include: NJ photo or non-photo driver's license; military or other government ID; student ID; employee ID; store membership card; US passport; or bank statement, car registration, government check or document, rent receipt, sample ballot, utility bill, or any other official document.
