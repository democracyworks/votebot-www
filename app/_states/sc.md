## Voter ID

When voting in person, you will be asked to show one of the following photo IDs at your polling place: SC driver's license, SC Department of Motor Vehicles ID Card, SC voter registration card with photo, federal military ID, or US passport.

Voters without ID: If you have a reasonable impediment to obtaining photo ID, you may vote a provisional ballot after showing your non-photo voter registration card. A reasonable impediment is any valid reason, beyond your control, which created an obstacle to obtaining photo ID. Some examples include: religious objection to being photographed, disability or illness, work schedule, lack of transportation, lack of birth certificate, or family responsibilities. If you do NOT have Photo ID and do NOT have a reasonable impediment to obtaining one, or you simply forgot to bring it with you to the polls, you may still vote a provisional ballot. However, for your vote to be counted, you must provide one of the photo IDs to the county election commission prior to certification of the election (usually Thursday or Friday after the election).
