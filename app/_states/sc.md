## Voter ID

You will need to show photo ID to vote in South Carolina. Acceptable forms include: South Carolina driver's license or South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles ID Card; South Carolina voter registration card with photo; US military ID; or US passport.

Voters without ID: If you have a reasonable impediment to obtaining photo ID, you may vote a provisional ballot after showing your non-photo voter registration card. If you do not have photo ID and do not have a reasonable impediment to obtaining one, or you simply forgot to bring it with you to the polls, you may still vote a provisional ballot. However, for your vote to be counted, you must provide one of the photo IDs to the county election commission prior to certification of the election (usually Thursday or Friday after the election).
