## Voter ID

If you pre-registered and have not moved or changed names, you do NOT need to bring additional identification to the polling place on Election Day.

If you are a first-time registrant in Minnesota who registered by mail and gave information on your registration application that could not be verified by election officials, you will be asked to prove where you reside before voting.

You have the option of bringing:

* 1) a valid ID with current name and address (e.g. valid, non-expired Minnesota driver’s license, Minnesota ID card, Minnesota learner’s permit, or a tribal ID card)
* 2) a photo ID and a document with current name and address (e.g. utility bill, bank statement, or lease)
* 3) a registered voter from your precinct who can confirm your name and address
* 4) notice of late registration
* 5) valid registration in the same precinct
* 6) college student ID (if a student housing list is provided)
* or 7) staff person of a residential facility.
