## Voter ID

You will need to show photo ID to vote in Virginia. Acceptable forms include (must be unexpired): Virginia driver’s license or photo ID; Virginia DMV-issued veteran’s ID card; US passport or passport card; US military ID; student photo ID issued by any institution of higher education or any private school in Virginia; another photo ID issued by the federal government, Virginia, or a local body of Virginia government; employee photo ID issued by your employer; tribal enrollment or other tribal ID if issued by one of 11 tribes recognized by Virginia; nursing home resident ID if issued by a government facility; or a Virginia voter photo ID obtained through any local general registrar’s office.

Voters without ID: If you don't show an acceptable form of photo ID, you will be given the opportunity to vote a provisional ballot. After completing the provisional ballot, you will be given written instructions from the election officials on how to submit a copy of your ID so that your vote can be counted. You will have until noon on the Friday following the election to deliver a copy of the ID to the local electoral board.

## Registering to Vote

### To register to vote in Virginia, you must agree to the following statements:

* I am a U.S. citizen, a resident of Virginia, at least 18 years old by the next general election, have had voting rights restored if convicted of a felony, and have had capacity restored by court order if declared mentally incapacitated.
* I swear/affirm, under felony penalty for making willfully false material statements or entries, that the information provided on this form is true. I authorize the cancellation of my current registration.
* When registering to vote, Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution of Virginia (1971) requires you to provide your social security number, if you have one. If you do not provide your social security number, your application will be denied. Voting officials use the social security number as a unique identifier to ensure that no voter is registered in more than one place.
* Your application will only be open to inspection by the public if the social security number is removed. Your social security number will appear on reports produced only for official use by voter registration and election officials, for jury selection purposes by courts, and all lawful purposes. Your decision to decline to register to vote as well as the office where you submit your application, if you choose to do so, are confidential and will only be used for voter registration purposes.
