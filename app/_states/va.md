## Voter ID

Virginia law requires all voters to provide an acceptable form of photo ID at the polls. Acceptable forms include a valid (non-expired): Virginia driver’s license or identification card,  Virginia DMV-issued veteran’s ID card, US Passport, other government-issued photo ID cards (must be issued by US Government, the Commonwealth of Virginia, or a political subdivision of the Commonwealth), college or university student photo ID card (must be from an institution of higher education located in Virginia), employee ID card containing a photograph of the voter and issued by an employer of the voter in the ordinary course of the employer’s business, or a Virginia voter photo ID Card obtained through any local general registrar’s office.

Voters without ID: A voter who arrives at the polling place without an acceptable form of photo identification will be given the opportunity to vote a provisional ballot. After completing the provisional ballot, the individual voting will be given written instructions from the election officials on how to submit a copy of his/her identification so that his/her vote can be counted. A voter will have until noon on the Friday following the election to deliver a copy of the identification to the local electoral board. Voters may submit a copy of their ID via fax, email, in-person submission, or through USPS or commercial delivery service.

## Registering to Vote

### To register to vote in Virginia, you must agree to the following statements:

* I am a U.S. citizen, a resident of Virginia, at least 18 years old by the next general election, have had voting rights restored if convicted of a felony, and have had capacity restored by court order if declared mentally incapacitated.
* I swear/affirm, under felony penalty for making willfully false material statements or entries, that the information provided on this form is true. I authorize the cancellation of my current registration.
* When registering to vote, Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution of Virginia (1971) requires you to provide your social security number, if you have one. If you do not provide your social security number, your application will be denied. Voting officials use the social security number as a unique identifier to ensure that no voter is registered in more than one place.
* Your application will only be open to inspection by the public if the social security number is removed. Your social security number will appear on reports produced only for official use by voter registration and election officials, for jury selection purposes by courts, and all lawful purposes. Your decision to decline to register to vote as well as the office where you submit your application, if you choose to do so, are confidential and will only be used for voter registration purposes.
