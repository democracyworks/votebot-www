## Voter ID

Voters must bring identification to the polls in order to verify identity.

Identification may include current and valid photo identification, a military identification, or a copy of a current (within the last 12 months) utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document, other than a notice of an election or a voter registration notification sent by a board of elections, that shows the voter’s name and current address.

Voters who do not provide one of these documents will still be able to vote by providing the last four digits of the voter’s Social Security number and by casting a provisional ballot.
