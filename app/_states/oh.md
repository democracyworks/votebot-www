## Voter ID

You will need to show ID to vote in Ohio. Acceptable forms include: an unexpired Ohio driver’s license or state ID card; a military ID; a photo ID issued by the US government or the State of Ohio, that contains the voter’s name and current address and that has an expiration date that has not passed; or a current utility bill (within the last 12 months), bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document (other than a notice of voter registration mailed by a board of elections) that shows the voter’s name and current address.

Voters without ID: If you do not provide one of these documents, you will still be able to vote by providing the last four digits of the your social security number and cast a provisional ballot. If you do not provide ID or the last four digits of your social security number at the precinct, you will still be able to vote using a provisional ballot. However, in order for that ballot to be counted, you must return to the board of elections no later than seven days following Election Day to provide a qualifying form of identification.
