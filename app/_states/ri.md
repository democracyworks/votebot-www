## Voter ID

Rhode Island state law requires all voters to present valid photo identification prior to voting at the polls in all elections. Voters will need to present one of the following forms of photo ID: RI driver's license, RI voter ID card, U.S. passport, ID issued by a U.S. educational institution, U.S. military ID, ID card issued by the United States or the State of Rhode Island, or a government-issued medical card.

Any voter who is unable to present valid identification at the polls, will be required to cast a provisional ballot. The local board shall examine each provisional ballot application to determine if the signature matches the signature on the voter's registration. If the signatures match, the provisional ballot shall count. If the signatures do not match, the ballot shall not count and shall be rejected as illegal.
