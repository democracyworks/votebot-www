## Voter ID

You may be asked to show identification if: you are voting for the first-time in Massachusetts, you are an inactive voter, you are casting a provisional or challenged ballot, or if the poll worker has a reasonable suspicion that leads them to request identification. Acceptable forms include (must show your name and address): a MA driver's license or state-issued ID card; recent utility bill; rent receipt; signed lease; a copy of a voter registration affidavit; or any other printed identification which contains the voter's name and address.

Voters without ID: If you're a first-time voter that is unable to present ID when you check in, you may cast a provisional ballot and return later with ID. If you do not return with acceptable ID by close of polls, your ballot cannot be counted. If you're asked for ID for any other reason, and are not able to present ID in such a situation, you must still be permitted to vote; however, your ballot must be challenged. Your ballot will be cast normally, and will only be re-examined in the case of a recount, court order, or audit.

## Registering to Vote
