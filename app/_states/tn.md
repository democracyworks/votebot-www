## Voter ID

You will need to show photo ID to vote in Tennessee. Acceptable forms include (can be expired): Tennessee driver’s license; US passport; photo ID issued by the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security; photo ID issued by the federal or Tennessee state government; US military photo ID; or Tennessee handgun carry permit with your photo. 

If you're a first-time voter who registered by mail, you will need to show ID to vote. Acceptable forms include: a current photo ID; or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck or other government document that shows your name and address.

Voters without ID: If you don’t bring a photo ID, you will vote a provisional ballot. You will then have two (2) business days after Election Day to return to the election commission office to show a valid photo ID. Upon returning to the election commission office, the voter will sign an affidavit and a copy of the voter’s photo ID will be made to be reviewed by the counting board.
