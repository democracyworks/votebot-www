## Voter ID

All voters must present a federal or Tennessee state ID containing the voter’s name and photograph when voting at the polls. Any of the following IDs may be used, even if expired: Tennessee driver’s license, U.S. passport, photo ID issued by the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security, photo ID issued by the federal or Tennessee state government, U.S. military photo ID, or Tennessee handgun carry permit with your photo. Federal law also requires first-time voters who register by mail to present one of the following: a current photo identification with voter’s name and photo OR if the photo identification is expired, the voter must also present one of the following: a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck or other government document that shows the voter’s name and address.

Voters without ID: If you don’t bring a photo ID, you will vote a provisional ballot. You will then have two (2) business days after Election Day to return to the election commission office to show a valid photo ID. Upon returning to the election commission office, the voter will sign an affidavit and a copy of the voter’s photo ID will be made to be reviewed by the counting board.
