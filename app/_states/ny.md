## Voter ID

If you've voted in New York before, you don’t need to provide ID to vote.

If you’re a first-time voter who registered by mail, and didn't provide a copy of your ID with your registration, you may need to show ID to vote. Acceptable forms include: a current and valid photo ID, or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows your name and address.
