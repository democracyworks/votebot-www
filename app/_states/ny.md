## Voter ID

If the driver's license number or social security number on your voter registration form was verified, you do not need to provide ID in order to vote.

Otherwise, as a first-time New York voter, you must show a current and valid photo identification or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows your name and address.
