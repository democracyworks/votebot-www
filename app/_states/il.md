## Voter ID

If you've voted in Illinois before, you don’t need to provide ID to vote.

If you’re a first-time voter who registered by mail, and didn’t provide your driver’s license number, state ID number, last 4 digits of your social security number, or a copy of a current ID or government document that shows your name and address when you registered, you’ll need to provide one of these when you vote.

## Registering to Vote

### To register to vote in Illinois, you must agree to the following statements:

* I am a citizen of the United States.
* I will be 17 years old on or before the date of the Primary Election and turn 18 on or before the date of the General Election.
* I will have lived in the State of Illinois and in my election precinct at least 30 days as of the date of the next election.
* I am the person whose name and identifying information is provided on this form, and I desire to register to vote in the State of Illinois.
* All the information I have provided on this form is true and correct as of the date I am submitting this form.
I authorize the Secretary of State to transmit to the State Board of Elections my signature that is on file with the Secretary of State and understand that such signature will be used by my local election authority on this online voter registration application for admission as an elector as if I had signed this form personally.
