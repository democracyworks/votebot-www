## Voter ID

You will need to show ID to vote in Montana. Acceptable forms include: a current photo ID showing your name; or a current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, voter registration confirmation, government check or other government document showing your current name and address.

Voters without ID: If you do not have any form of ID, you can still vote by requesting and filling out a “Polling Place Elector ID” form. Or, you can vote a provisional ballot. Your provisional ballot will be counted if you provide one of the items on the list to the county election office by 5:00 p.m. the day after the election, or mail it to the county election office postmarked by the day after the election.
