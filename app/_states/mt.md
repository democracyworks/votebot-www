## Voter ID

Before an elector is permitted to receive a ballot or vote, the elector shall present to an election judge a current photo identification showing the elector's name.

If the elector does not present photo identification the elector shall present one of several specified documents showing the elector’s name and current address. Acceptable forms of ID include: driver’s license; school district or postsecondary education photo identification; tribal photo identification; current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, notice of confirmation of voter registration, government check, or other government document that shows the elector's name and current address.

Voters without ID: If the identification presented is insufficient to verify the elector's identity and eligibility to vote or if the elector's name does not appear in the precinct register, the elector may sign the precinct register and cast a provisional ballot.
