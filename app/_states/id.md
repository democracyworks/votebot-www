## Voter ID

A registered voter must either present a photo ID or sign a Personal Identification Affidavit to vote.

Forms of acceptable photo ID may be any one of the following: Idaho driverâ€™s license or Idaho ID card, U.S. passport or federal photo ID card, tribal photo ID card, or a current student photo ID, issued by an Idaho high school or post secondary education institution.

If a voter is not able to show an acceptable ID, the voter will be given the option to sign the Personal Identification Affidavit. After signing the Affidavit, the voter will be issued a ballot to be tabulated with all other ballots.
