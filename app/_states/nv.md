## Voter ID

If you are voting in Nevada for the first time, you must present (1) a current and valid photo identification, which shows physical address; or (2) a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, or document issued by a governmental entity, including a check which indicates name and address, but not including a voter registration card issued pursuant to NRS 293.517.

Otherwise, according to Nevada law, a voter does not need to present an ID to vote as long as their name appears in the election board register and their signature matches the signature on the record.
