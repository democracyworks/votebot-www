## Voter ID

If you've voted in Nevada before, you do not have to show ID to vote as long as your name appears in the election board register and your signature matches the signature on the record. 

If you're a first-time voter, you must show ID to vote. Acceptable forms include: a current and valid photo identification, which shows physical address; or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, or document issued by a governmental entity, including a check which indicates name and address, but not including a voter registration card issued pursuant to NRS 293.517.
