## Voter ID

You will need to show ID to vote in Connecticut.

Acceptable forms of ID include: social security card; any other preprinted form of identification which shows the elector's name and either the elector's address, signature or photograph.

First-time voters who registered by mail after January 1, 2003, are voting for the first time in a primary/general election with federal candidates on the ballot, and have a “mark” next to their name on the official registry list will need to present either: a current and valid photo ID that shows their name and address, copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck or government document that shows your name and address.  Otherwise, that voter will need to cast a provisional ballot.

Voters without ID: you will be asked, on a form prescribed by the Secretary of the State, to write your residential address and date of birth, print your name, and sign a statement under penalty of false statement that you are the elector whose name appears on the official checklist.
