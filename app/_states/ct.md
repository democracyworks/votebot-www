## Voter ID

You will need to show ID to vote in Connecticut.

Acceptable forms include: social security card; or any other pre-printed form of ID that shows your name and address, signature, or photograph.

If you're a first-time voter who registered by mail, is voting in a primary/general election with federal candidates on the ballot, and has a “mark” next to your name on the official registry list, you will need to show ID to vote. Acceptable forms include: a current and valid photo ID that shows their name and address; or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck or government document that shows your name and address.

Voters without ID: If you do not show ID, you will need to cast a provisional ballot.
