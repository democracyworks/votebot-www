## Voter ID

If you've voted in Arkansas before, you don’t need to provide ID to vote. 

If you’re voting for the first-time in Arkansas, registered to vote by mail, and didn’t submit a copy of your ID when you registered, you will need to show ID to vote. Acceptable forms include: a driver’s license or non-driver’s license ID; or a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document with your name and address. 

Voters without ID: If you don’t present the necessary ID, the election official will instruct you on voting a Provisional Ballot.
