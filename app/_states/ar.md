## Voter ID

Poll workers are required by law to ask for identification; however, voters are not required to provide identification in order to vote, unless they are a first-time voter. If you are voting in Arkansas for the first time, you will need to show ID. Acceptable forms of ID include: current valid driver's license, other photo ID; current utility bill; bank statement; paycheck; government check; other government document showing the voter's name and address.
