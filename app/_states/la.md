## Voter ID

You will need to show photo ID to vote in Louisiana. Acceptable forms of photo ID include: a Louisiana driver's license or special ID card; or some other generally recognized picture ID that contains your name and signature.

If you're a first-time voter that registered by mail, and didn't provide your driverâ€™s license number, state ID number, or the last 4 digits of your social security number on your registration form, you will need to show ID to vote. Acceptable forms include: a photo ID, utility bill, bank statement, or other government document that shows your name and address.

Voters without ID: If you do not have ID, you may still cast your vote by signature on a voter affidavit.
