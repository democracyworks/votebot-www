## Voter ID

You will need to provide photo ID to vote in Louisiana. Be sure to take one of the following: a driver's license; a Louisiana special ID; or some other generally recognized picture ID that contains your name and signature.

Voters without ID: If you do not have a driver's license, Louisiana Special ID, or some other generally recognized picture ID that contains your name and signature, you may still cast your vote by signature on a voter affidavit.
