## Voter ID

If you choose to vote in-person in Washington, you will need to show photo ID to vote. Acceptable forms include: Washington driver’s license or state ID card; student ID card; tribal ID card; or an employer ID card.

Voters without ID: If you don’t have a photo ID and want to vote in-person, you’ll have to vote a provisional ballot. Your ballot will count if the signature on your ballot declaration matches the signature on your voter registration record.
