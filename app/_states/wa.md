## Voter ID

Any person desiring to vote in person in Washington is required to sign a declaration, regardless of whether or not they have a valid photo ID. If the voter does not have a valid photo ID, then Accessible Voting Center staff will verify that the signature on the accessible voting form matches the signature on the voter registration file. Signature verification is not necessary if the voter has a valid photo ID. 

Acceptable forms of photo identification include: driver’s license, state-issued identification card, student identification card, tribal identification card, employer identification card, or any form of valid photo identification with the voter’s name on it.
