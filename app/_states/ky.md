## Voter ID

Unless you are acquainted with the precinct election officers, you will be asked to show identification before voting. Types of identification that are allowed include: driverâ€™s license, social security card, credit card, or another form of identification containing both picture and signature.

Voters without ID: When the officers of an election disagree as to the qualifications of a voter or if his right to vote is disputed by a challenger, the voter shall sign a written oath as to his qualifications before he is permitted to vote.
