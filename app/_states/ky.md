## Voter ID

You will need to show ID, or be known personally by a precinct election officer, to vote in Kentucky. Acceptable forms include: driverâ€™s license, social security card, ID issued by the US government, ID issued by the Kentucky government, or any form of ID containing both your picture and signature.

You can vote a provisional ballot (federal elections only) in the following circumstances: you do not have ID; your name does not appear on the precinct roster and your registration status cannot be verified; your name is not on the precinct roster and you have been verified as ineligible to vote; you are voting as a result of a federal or state court order or any order under state law in effect 10 days prior to Election Day that extends polling hours; or you were challenged by all four precinct election officers.
