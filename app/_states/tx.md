## Voter ID

You will be asked to show photo ID to vote in Texas. Acceptable forms include (must be current or expired less than 4 years): Texas driver's license issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS); Texas election ID certificate; Texas personal ID card; Texas handgun license; US military ID with photo; US citizenship certificate with photograph (doesn't need to be current); or a US passport.

Voters without ID: If you don't have ID and and cannot obtain one due to a reasonable impediment, you'll need to sign a sworn statement that there is a reason why you don’t have any of the accepted IDs, and present one of the following: certified birth certificate (original); valid voter registration certificate; or a current utility bill, government check, bank statement or paycheck, or government document with your name and an address (original required if it contains a photograph). If you meet these requirements and are eligible to vote, you may vote in the election.

If you don't have ID and do not have a reasonable impediment to obtaining one, or did not bring ID to the polling place, you may cast a provisional ballot. In order to have the provisional ballot counted, you will be required to visit the voter registrar’s office within six (6) calendar days of the date of the election to either present one of the forms of photo ID or submit one a temporary affidavit in the presence of the county voter registrar while attesting to the fact that you do not have any of the required photo IDs.
