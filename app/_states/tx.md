## Voter ID

All voters are required to present an approved form of photo identification in order to vote in all Texas elections. Acceptable forms of photo ID: Texas driver's license issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), Texas election identification certificate issued by DPS, Texas personal identification card issued by DPS, Texas concealed handgun license issued by DPS, U.S. military ID with photo, U.S. citizenship certificate with photograph, or a U.S. passport. With the exception of the U.S. citizenship certificate, the identification must be current or have expired no more than 4 years before being presented for voter qualification at the polling place. If the name does not match exactly but is "substantially similar" to the name on the list of registered voters, the voter will be permitted to vote as long as the voter signs an affidavit stating that the voter is the same person.

Voters without ID: If the voter was unable to obtain one of the seven forms of approved photo identification, you can exercise your vote after (1) sign a declaration in the voting booth explaining the reasons why it has not able to obtain one of the seven forms of identification approved photo identification and (2) presenting one of the various forms of additional identification. Additional forms of identification include: certified birth certificate (original), certificate valid voter registration, recent utility bill (original or copy), bank statement (original or copy), government check (the original or copy), paycheck (original or copy) or other government document with the name and address of the elector (original or copy). If you have a government document containing a photograph, the document must be original. If the voter meets these requirements and is eligible to vote, you may exercise their vote in the election.

If a voter (a) does not have one of the acceptable forms of photo identification, which is not expired for more than four years, and a voter does not have a reasonable impediment to obtaining one of these forms of identification or (b) has, but did not bring to the polling place, one of the seven forms of acceptable photo identification, which is not expired for more than four years, the voter may cast a provisional ballot at the polls. However, in order to have the provisional ballot counted, the voter will be required to visit the voter registrarâ€™s office within six calendar days of the date of the election to either present one of the forms of photo ID OR submit one of the temporary affidavits (e.g., religious objection or natural disaster) in the presence of the county voter registrar while attesting to the fact that he or she does not have any of the required photo IDs.
