## Voter ID

If the driver's license number or social security number on your voter registration form was verified, you do not need to provide ID in order to vote. If you are voting for the first time after registering to vote by mail and did not provide your driver's license number, North Carolina identification number or the last four digits of your social security number on your registration form, you may be asked to show a form of identification when you go to the polls. In this case, be sure to bring a current and valid photo ID or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, student identification card showing your name and photograph, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows your name and address.
