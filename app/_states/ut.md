Acceptable forms of non-photo ID include (present 2): current utility bill dated within 90 days before the election; bank or other financial account statement; certified birth certificate; Social Security card; a check issued by the state or federal government; paycheck; Utah hunting or fishing license; US military ID card; certified naturalization documents, but not a green card; a certified copy of court records showing your adoption or name change; Bureau of Indian Affairs card; a tribal treaty card; Medicaid or Medicare or Electronic Benefits Transfer card; ID card issued by a local government within Utah; ID card issued by your employer; ID card issued by a college, university, technical school or professional school within Utah; or a current Utah vehicle registration.

Voters without ID: If you do not have ID, you may cast a provisional ballot or a county clerk can verify your identity and residence if you fail to provide valid ID.
