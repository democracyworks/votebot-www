## Voter ID

In order to vote in Utah, you need valid voter ID. This is either a form of identification that bears the name and photograph of the voter or two forms of identification that bear the name of the voter and provide evidence of the voter’s residence. In Utah, these forms of identification include a current, valid: Utah driver license; ID card issued by the state or a branch, department, or agency of the United States; Utah permit to carry a concealed weapon; US passport; or a tribal ID card, whether or not the card includes a photograph of the voter. 

Otherwise, you will need to present TWO forms of identification that bear the name of the voter and provide evidence that the voter resides in the voting precinct, which may include: a current utility bill or copy dated within 90 days before the election; a bank or other financial account statement, or legible copy; a certified birth certificate; a valid Social Security card; a check issued by the state or federal government or legible copy; a paycheck from the voter’s employer, or legible copy; a currently-valid Utah hunting or fishing license; a currently-valid U.S. military ID card; certified naturalization documents (NOT a green card); a certified copy of court records showing the voter’s adoption or name change; a Bureau of Indian Affairs card; a tribal treaty card; a valid Medicaid or Medicare or Electronic Benefits Transfer card; a currently-valid ID card issued by a local government within the state; a currently-valid ID card issued by an employer; a currently-valid ID card issued by a college, university, technical school or professional school within the state; or a current Utah vehicle registration.

Voters without ID: The voter may cast a provisional ballot. A county clerk may verify the identity and residence of a voter who fails to provide valid voter identification through some other means.
