## Voter ID

If you've voted in Maryland before, you don’t need to provide ID to vote.

If you’re a first-time voter that registered by mail, and didn’t provide a copy of your Maryland driver’s license, state ID card, or a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or government document that shows your name and address when you registered, you may need to show one of these documents to vote.
