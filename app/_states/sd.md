## Voter ID

All voters who appear at a polling place must show proof of identification. Approved forms of photo identification include: South Dakota driver's license or nondriver ID card, U.S. government photo ID, U.S. Armed Forces ID, student photo ID from a South Dakota high school or South Dakota accredited institution of higher education, or a tribal photo ID.

If you do not have a photo ID, you can sign a personal identification affidavit and still be allowed to vote.
