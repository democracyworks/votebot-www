## Voter ID

Registered voters do not have to show ID to vote in the District of Columbia.

If you are a first-time voter, you will need to show proof of residence in order to cast a regular ballot. Acceptable forms of proof of residency include: a current and valid photo ID; a current utility bill (not including cell phone bills); bank statement; government check; paycheck; or another government document that shows your name and address. Student voters may also present housing assignment forms and/or tuition or housing bills from District colleges and universities as proof of residence, and homeless residents may present occupancy statements from District homeless shelters.
