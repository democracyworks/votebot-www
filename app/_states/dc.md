## Voter ID

If you've voted in DC before, you don’t need to provide ID to vote.

If you’re a first-time voter who registered by mail, and didn’t provide proof of residence when registering, you will need to show proof of residence to vote. Acceptable forms include: a current and valid government-issued photo ID; or a current utility bill (not including cell phone bills), bank statement, government check, paycheck, lease or rental agreement, university housing or tuition bill, or another government document that shows your name and address.
