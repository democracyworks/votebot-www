## Voter ID

If the driver's license number or social security number on your voter registration form was verified, you do not need to provide ID in order to vote in California.

If you are voting for the first time after registering to vote by mail and did not provide your driver's license number, California identification number or the last four digits of your social security number on your registration form, you may be asked to show a form of identification when you go to the polls. In this case, be sure to bring a current and valid photo ID or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, student identification card showing your name and photograph, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows your name and address.

## Registering to Vote

### To register to vote in California, you must agree to the following statements:

* I am a U.S. citizen and will be at least 18 years old on election day.
* I am not currently imprisoned or on parole for the conviction of a felony.
* I understand that it is a crime to intentionally provide incorrect information on this form.
* The information on this form is true and correct.
