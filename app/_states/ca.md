## Voter ID

If you've voted in California before, you don't need to show ID. 

If you’re a first-time voter who registered by mail, and didn’t include your driver’s license number, California ID number, or the last 4 digits of your social security number on your registration, you may be asked to provide ID when you vote. Acceptable forms include: a current and valid photo ID; or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows your name and address.

## Registering to Vote

### To register to vote in California, you must agree to the following statements:

* I am a U.S. citizen and will be at least 18 years old on election day.
* I am not currently imprisoned or on parole for the conviction of a felony.
* I understand that it is a crime to intentionally provide incorrect information on this form.
* The information on this form is true and correct.
