## Voter ID

State law requires that all voters show photo identification each time they vote. Acceptable forms of identification include: a driver’s license or non-driver’s ID card, a concealed carry handgun license, U.S. passport, government employee ID, military ID, student ID, public assistance ID or Indian tribal ID.

Exceptions: Persons age 65 or older may use expired photo ID documents. Any person whose religious beliefs prohibit photographic identification may be exempted from the photo ID requirement. Any such person must complete and sign a Form DRO (Declaration of Religious Objection).
