## Voter ID

If you are voting in Maine for the first time, you must show ID. Acceptable forms of ID include: Maine driver's license or other valid photo ID, or a current utility bill, or bank statement, or paycheck, or other government document that shows the voter's name and address.

Voters without ID may cast a challenged ballot and may be asked to produce ID afterward.
