## Voter ID

If you've voted in Maine before, you don’t need to provide ID to vote.

If you’re a first-time voter that registered by mail, and didn’t provide a copy of your Maine driver’s license, Maine state ID card, or a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or government document that shows your name and address when you registered, you may need to show one of these documents to vote.

Voters without ID: If you don’t have ID or proof of residence, you can cast a challenged ballot.  You may be asked to show ID after the election.

## Check Your Registration

Call [(207) 624-7650](tel:207-624-7650) or your [local registrar](http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/munic.html)
