## Voter ID

You will need to show current photo ID to vote in Michigan. Acceptable forms include: Michigan driver’s license or state ID card; current (non-expired) driver’s license or personal ID card issued by another state; federal or state government-issued photo ID; US passport; military ID card with a photo; tribal ID card with a photo; or a student ID with a photo from a high school or an accredited institution of higher education.

Voters without ID: If you do not bring a photo ID to the polls or do not own photo ID, you can vote like any other voter by signing an affidavit.
