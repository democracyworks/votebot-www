## Voter ID

Every Michigan voter who offers to vote in the polls must comply with the requirement by showing picture identification or signing an affidavit attesting that he or she is not in possession of picture identification. You can satisfy the ID requirement by showing a Michigan driver’s license or state ID card, or a current (non-expired) driver’s license or ID card issued by another state, a federal or state government-issued photo ID, a U.S. passport, a military ID card with a photo, a tribal ID card with a photo, or a student ID with a photo from a high school or an accredited institution of higher education.

If you do not bring a picture ID to the polls or do not own picture ID, you can vote like any other voter by signing an affdavit.
