## Voter ID

State law requires all registered voters to prove their identity before voting. You may show any document issued by the United States, the State of Oklahoma, or a federally recognized tribal government if it includes your name, a photograph of you, and an expiration date that is later than the election in which you are voting. For example, the following documents meet these requirements: Oklahoma driver license; Oklahoma Identification Card; United States passport; United States military identification. The law also requires that your name on your proof of identity must match your name in the Precinct Registry.

There are two alternatives to showing a photo identification: 1. You may show the free Voter Identification Card issued by the County Election Board as proof of identity even though it does not include a photograph. 2. You may vote by provisional ballot and prove your identity by signing a sworn affidavit.

If you do not show proof of identity, you may vote only by provisional ballot. Voters who cast provisional ballots are required to fill out and sign an affidavit that explains why their provisional ballot should be counted. Provisional ballots are sealed inside special envelopes and are not put through the voting device. After election day, County Election Board officials will investigate the information provided by the voter on the affidavit and either will approve the provisional ballot for counting or will reject it based on the outcome of that investigation. In order for a provisional ballot to be approved for counting, the information on the affidavit must match the information in the voter's registration record.
