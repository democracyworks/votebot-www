## Voter ID

You will need to show photo ID to vote in Oklahoma. You may show any document issued by the United States, the State of Oklahoma, or a federally recognized tribal government if it includes your name (must match your name in the Precinct Registry), a photo, and an expiration date that is later than the election in which you are voting. Acceptable forms include: Oklahoma driver's license; Oklahoma ID Card; US passport; tribal ID; US military ID; or county election board voter ID card.

Voters without ID: If you do not show ID, you may vote by provisional ballot.
