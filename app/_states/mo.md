## Voter ID

You will need to show ID to vote in Missouri. Acceptable forms include: ID issued by the state of Missouri, an agency of the state, or a local election authority of the state; ID issued by the United States government or agency thereof; ID issued by an institution of higher education, including a university, college, vocational and technical school, located within the state of Missouri; a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, government check or other government document that contains the name and address of the voter; driver's license or state identification card issued by another state.

Voters without ID: If you do not have ID, you may still cast a ballot if two supervising election judges, one from each major political party, attest that they know you.
