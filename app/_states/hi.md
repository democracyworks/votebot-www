## Voter ID

If you've voted in Hawaii before, you don’t need to provide ID to vote.

If you’re a first-time voter who registered by mail, and didn’t provide a copy of your ID when you registered, you will need to show ID to vote. Acceptable forms include: current driver's license or state ID card; or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, or other government issued document that shows your name and address.
