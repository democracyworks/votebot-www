## Voter ID

Public Law 109-2005 requires Indiana residents to present a government-issued photo ID before casting a ballot at the polls on Election Day. Your photo ID must meet 4 criteria to be acceptable for voting purposes. It Must: 1. Display your photo, 2. Display your name, and the name must conform to your voter registration record. (Conform does not mean identical), 3. Display an expiration date and either be current or have expired sometime after the date of the last General Election, and 4. Be issued by the State of Indiana or the U.S. government. In most cases, an Indiana driver license, Indiana photo ID card, Military ID or U.S. Passport is sufficient. A student ID from an Indiana State school may only be used if it meets all of the 4 criteria. A student ID from a private institution may not be used for voting purposes.

If you are unable or unwilling to present ID meeting these requirements, you may cast a provisional ballot. If you cast a provisional ballot, you have until noon 10 days after the election to follow up with the county election board and either provide the necessary documentation or affirm one of the lawâ€™s exemptions applies to you.
