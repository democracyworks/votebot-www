You will need to show photo ID to vote in Mississippi. Acceptable forms include: Mississippi driver's license or state ID card; US passport; employee ID card issued by any agency of the US government, State of Mississippi, or local government unit in Mississippi; firearms license; student photo ID issued by an accredited Mississippi university, college, or community/junior college; US military ID; or a tribal photo ID.
