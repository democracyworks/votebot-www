## Voter ID

If you've voted in Nebraska before, you do not have to show ID to vote.

If you’re a first-time voter who registered to vote by mail, and didn’t include a copy of your ID when you registered, you’ll need to show ID to vote. Acceptable forms include: any current photo ID; or a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows your name and address.
