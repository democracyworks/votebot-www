## Voter ID

The only time voters are asked for their ID is if they are a first-time Nebraska registrant who mailed in their registration application and didnâ€™t provide ID at that time. If you are voting in Nebraska for the first time, you must provide (a) current, valid photo ID or (b) copy of utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document dated within the past sixty days, showing the same name and residence address provided on registration application.
