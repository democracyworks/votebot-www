## Voter ID

If you've voted in Pennsylvania before, you don't need to show ID to vote.

If you're a first-time voter, you must show photo ID to vote. Acceptable forms include: Pennsylvania driverâ€™s license or PennDOT ID card; ID issued by Pennsylvania or the US government; US passport; US military ID; student ID; employee ID; a confirmation issued by the County Voter Registration Office; non-photo ID issued by Pennsylvania or the US government; firearm permit; or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, or a government check that includes your name and address.
