Acceptable forms include: photo ID; student ID card; ID issued by an Indian nation, tribe or pueblo; or a copy of a utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows your name and current address.

You will be issued a provisional ballot if your name does not appear on the roster at your polling place or If you're a first-time voter who registered by mail and do not provide the required identification.
