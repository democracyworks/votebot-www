## Voter ID

If you registered for the first time in New Mexico using a mail-in application and did not include one of the required forms of ID with your application, you will be required to present one of the following forms of identification when voting for the first time:

(A) a physical form of identification, which may be: (1) an original or copy of a current and valid photo identification with or without an address, which address is not required to match the voter's certificate of registration or a voter identification card: or (2) an original or copy of a utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, student identification card or other government document, including identification issued by an Indian nation, tribe or pueblo, that shows the name and address of the person, the address of which is not required to match the voter's certificate of registration;

or (B) a verbal or written statement by the voter of the voter's name, year of birth and registered address; provided, however, that the statement of the voter's name need not contain the voter's middle initial or suffix.

If you fail to provide either the written or verbal required identification, you will be allowed to vote on a provisional ballot.
