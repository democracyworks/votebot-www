: ## How does this work?

  HelloVote asks you a series of questions and uses your answers to fill out
  your state's voter registration form. In states that support online voter
  registration, HelloVote will submit your information and automatically
  register you to vote. In all other states, we will mail you
  pre-addressed, stamped envelope with your form that must be signed and
  mailed by you to complete your registration.

  Before submitting your registration, HelloVote will give you
  the chance to verify your information is correct. Importantly, do not
  provide false information as your state will consider that a criminal offense.
