  <p>
    HelloVote asks you a series of questions by text message or Facebook
    Messenger, and uses your answers to fill out your state’s voter registration
    form. In some states we submit your form directly, online. No other service
    makes it this easy!  In other states, we can e-mail (or mail) a pre-stamped
    form that you just have to sign and mail, to register. We also provide links
    to your state's own online registration system, if they have one.
  </p>
  <p>
    (Note that, before submitting your registration, HelloVote will give
    you the chance to verify your information is correct. Importantly, do not
    provide false information as your state will consider that a criminal
    offense.)
