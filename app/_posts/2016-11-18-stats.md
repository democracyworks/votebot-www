# Wrap Up

HelloVote was an experiment in civic engagement via mobile voter registration, and was built and launched on a rapid timeline.

Starting in June, we built a team and a technology platform to let us communicate and engage with users on important issues at scale. We wrote a custom bot framework, form integrations with twelve state websites, a PDF generator, a personalized notification system, a "studio" to let people create their own compelling messages to register and vote, and a web-app to take #ivoted selfies.

We launched in mid-September in the week before [National Voter Registration Day](http://nationalvoterregistrationday.org) to great press and social media excitement. HelloVote was covered in [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/register-to-vote-via-text-facebook-hellovote-2016-9), [Bustle](http://www.bustle.com/articles/185688-how-to-register-to-vote-on-facebook-using-hellovote-the-answer-to-the-busy-millennials-prayers), [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/hellovote-voter-registration-texting-facebook-messenger-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-election/), [CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/22/technology/hellovote-text-to-vote/), [FastCompany](https://www.fastcompany.com/3063969/mind-and-machine/this-chatbot-will-register-you-to-vote-by-text-so-now-you-have-no-excuse), [Glamour](http://www.glamour.com/story/register-to-vote-with-a-text-message), [Recode](http://www.recode.net/2016/9/22/13020980/chatbot-voter-registration-text), [Seventeen](http://www.seventeen.com/life/tech-social-media/news/a42975/no-more-excuses-you-can-now-register-to-vote-through-test-message/) and [VentureBeat](http://venturebeat.com/2016/09/22/backed-by-anti-trump-twilio-this-bot-wants-to-register-voters/). We were also tweeted in the same day by Ellen Degeneres, Bernie Sanders, Mindy Kaling, and internet impresarios Xeni Jardin and Anil Dash. MTV also featured our shortcode [384-387](sms://384387) on a one-day resurrection of TRL, redubbed [Total Registrations Live](http://electthis.com/trl), which included appearances by Kendall Jenner, Joss Whedon, Common, Ty Dolla $ign, and Nico Tortorello.

Other celebrities engaged in a bit of a friendly competition spearheaded by Chris Sacca, and included Kristen Bell, Sophia Bush, Grace Helbig, Aasif Mandvi, OK Go, Pearl Jam, Edward Norton, and Hunter Walk. Partner organizations included Bazta Arpaio, Common Cause, Credo, DailyKos, Headcount, Million Voters Project, NextGen, OneArizona, SEIU CA, SURJ, Upworthy, and others. We also helped companies register their employees and visitors, including Genius, Lenny Letter, Private Internet Access, Salesforce, the Shaderoom, Twilio, Walker and Co, and Wordpress.com.

On Election Day we sent personalized and actionable reminder messages to Get Out The Vote, including calendar invitations, local weather forecasts, polling place reminders and directions, and an easy to use issue reporting tool that integrated with ProPublica's [ElectionLand](https://projects.propublica.org/electionland/). We also answered hundreds of individual questions sent to team@hello.vote, and assisted users with finding legal advice when necessary via the Election Protection hotline. We also saw renewed press coverage in [CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/07/technology/election-polls-tech-tools/index.html) and [Fast Company](https://news.fastcompany.com/finally-hellovote-gives-you-a-legitimate-reason-to-take-a-selfie-4024066), and shares by Craig Newmark, Upworthy and Alexis Ohanian.

We sent users over 4.5 million messages across all our channels, and saw over 2,300 #ivoted selfies posted to our Twitter [wall of fame](https://twitter.com/hellovote_bot). User engagement with HelloVote was incredible, and the team's experience building compelling products with a real-world impact was invaluable.

Thanks to our team, all our organizational and celebrity partners, and users HelloVote was a great success. Fight for the Future will continue to experiment with new avenues for engaging everyone in the democratic process.
